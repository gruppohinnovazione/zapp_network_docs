üß≠ CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Centrality of the human being**  
   Technology must be designed to serve humans, not to dominate, surveil, or manipulate them.

2. **Distributed ethics**  
   Every technological implementation must be built upon transparent, local, and ethical social contracts. Ethics is not an add-on, it is the core architecture.

3. **Accessibility and inclusion**  
   Access to technology must be democratic, sustainable, and aimed at reducing inequality.

4. **Data sovereignty**  
   Every individual has the right to own, control, and protect their personal digital data.

5. **Decentralization as a safeguard**  
   The concentration of technological power is dangerous. Blockchain, federated networks, and local governance are tools of resilience and resistance.
